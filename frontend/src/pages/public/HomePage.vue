      <h1>Welcome to Your Farm Metric Application</h1>
      <p>With this application, you can record metrics from devices on your farm, query them, set up alerts, and add
        devices as needed.</p>
      <p>Farmers have always relied on their experience and intuition to manage their farms. However, as farming practices
        become more complex and the demand for food increases, the need for accurate and up-to-date data is becoming
        increasingly important. By recording metrics such as weather patterns, crop yields, and livestock health, farmers
        can gain insights into the performance of their farm and make data-driven decisions about how to improve
        efficiency and productivity. These metrics can also be used to track progress over time and identify areas for
        improvement. Additionally, by setting up alerts for their farm, farmers can be notified of potential issues before
        they become major problems. For example, if there is a sudden drop in temperature, an alert can be sent to the
        farmer to take action to protect their crops or livestock. By being proactive and staying informed, farmers can
        minimize risk and maximize their yields.</p>
